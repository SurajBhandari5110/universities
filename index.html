        <h1>Evolution of Central Universities:
        </h1>
        <p>
            Central universities or union universities in India are public universities established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education.[1] In general, universities in India are recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956.[2] In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination.[3] Central universities, in addition, are covered by the Central Universities Act, 2009, which regulates their purpose, powers, governance etc., and established 12 new universities.[4] As of 31 March 2021, The list of central universities published by the UGC includes 54 central universities.[5]

            Apart from the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees. These institutes do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called "universities" but "autonomous organisations" or "autonomous institutes". They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education.[6] These organisations include the Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Engineering Science and Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management, the National Law Schools, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and other autonomous institutes.

        <h2>Indian Institute Of Science Bangalore</h2>
        <p>The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is a public, deemed, research university for higher education and research in science, engineering, design, and management. It is located in Bengaluru, in the Indian state of Karnataka. The institute was established in 1909 with active support from Jamsetji Tata and thus is also locally known as the "Tata Institute".[5] It is ranked among the most prestigious academic institutions in India[6] and has the highest citation per faculty among all the universities in the world.[7] It was granted the deemed to be university status in 1958 and the Institute of Eminence status in 2018.</p>
        <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/indian-institute-science"><img src="a1.jpg" alt="img"></a>
        <div>The constitution of the institute was approved by the Viceroy, Lord Minto, and the necessary Vesting Order to enable it to function was signed on 27 May 1909.[19] Early in 1911, the Maharaja of Mysore laid the foundation stone of the institute, and on 24 July, the first batch of students were admitted to the Departments of General and Applied Chemistry under Norman Rudolf and Electro-Technology under Alfred Hay. Within two months, the Department of Organic Chemistry was opened. In 1958 the institute was granted the deemed university status by the UGC.</div>
        <h2>Institute Of Chemical Technology</h2>
        <p>Established on October 1, 1933 as University Department of Chemical Technology (popularly called UDCT) of the University of Bombay (now Mumbai), with the noble intention of advancing Indiaâ€™s knowledge reserves in chemical science and technology, the Institute has grown to become a premier (deemed) university devoted to education, training, research and industrial collaboration in chemical engineering, chemical technology, applied chemistry, pharmacy, biotechnology and bio-processing. The then UDCT grew in stature over the years and was granted partial autonomy by the University of Mumbai in 1985, which was taken to the next echelon under the concept of autonomy propagated by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Due to its size and spread of activities, it was converted into University Institute of Chemical Technology (UICT) on 26th January, 2002 and under the TEQIP of the World Bank it was granted full autonomy in 2004. Upon strong recommendation of the UGC through a peer review process, the autonomous institute status was finally converted in to a Deemed-to-be-University by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Govt. of India, on 12 September 2008. Seven convocations have so far taken place in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, 2017 and 2018.</p>
        <a href="https://www.ictmumbai.edu.in/"><img width="60%" height="40%" src="a2.jpg" alt="img"></a>
        <p>Based on its stellar performance over the years, the Government of Maharashtra granted it the Elite Status and Centre of Excellence in the State Assembly on April 20, 2012. This is a singular distinction accorded to any institute in the entire country and speaks volumes about the achievements of the ICT.</p>

        <h1>Evolution of State Universities</h1>
    <p>In India, state universities are run and funded by the state government of each of the states of India.

        Following the adoption of the Constitution of India in 1950, education became a state responsibility. Following a constitutional change in 1976, it became a joint responsibility of the states and the central government.State universities are public universities run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India, and are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. The University Grants Commission (UGC), draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956.[1] In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination.[2] The UGC publishes and regularly updates the lists of state universities.[3] As of 4 March 2021, the UGC lists 443 state universities.[4][note 1] The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai. </p>

        <h1>Evolution of Private Universities</h1>
        <p>
            India has a great advantage moving forwardâ€”the number and percentage of our young people. What is necessary to unlock this great potential is the education of our youthâ€”we must impart the skills and knowledge that help them become gainfully employed and lead our country to prosperity. Considering the Gross Enrolment Ratio targets and the numbers of students entering the school system through the Right to Education Act, the Government had, many years ago, calculated that another 1,500 universities were needed in India. The realisation that it would be difficult for it to establish so many on its own led to the growth of private universities.

I call the phenomena of private universities in India a revolution because, over the years, everyone, from the Government to benefactors of universities, experienced a steep and tough learning curve. They had to learn how to empower private foundations to create and run quality private universities, without stifling them with regulation. One excellent policy is â€˜graded autonomyâ€™â€”universities that perform well on established parameters get increasing autonomy from regulations. I believe that the Government should set very high entry barriers for permission to establish private universities. That will allow reputable universities to create, with supervision that is enabling.
The agility and speed in decision making of private universities is another strong foundation of their success. In an era when technology is advancing rapidly, where current job profiles will be redundant in the future and new skills will be needed, universities that cannot adapt and innovate will not survive. One example is the curriculumâ€”in traditional universities, it is reviewed once every five years. In good private universities, it is in continuous evolution in close cooperation with the industry.

        <h1>University System in India</h1>
        <p>Some institutions of India, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), University of Delhi, University of Calcutta, University of Madras, Jawaharlal Nehru University have been globally acclaimed for their standard of education.[14][18][19][20] However, Indian universities still lag behind universities such as Harvard, Cambridge, and Oxford.[21]

            Indian higher education is radical in terms of accessibility, and needs radical reforms in standards, giving value, and pacing. A focus on enforcing both streamlining and holding higher standards of curriculum with the help of international academic publishers for transparency,[22] making the vocational and doctoral education pipeline value-oriented and innovative, personalisation of the sector for students to gain immediate and valid transferable credentials in their own pace (e.g., Massive open online course, digital learning,[23] etc.)</p>
